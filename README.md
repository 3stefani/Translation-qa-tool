## 📊 MQM Framework

This tool implements the **Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM)** framework, an industry standard for translation quality assessment used by companies like Google, Microsoft, and major Language Service Providers.

### Error Categories

| Category | Description | Example Types |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Accuracy** | Content correctly transferred from source | Mistranslation, Omission, Addition |
| **Fluency** | Text reads naturally in target language | Grammar, Spelling, Punctuation |
| **Style** | Appropriate tone and register | Awkward phrasing, Register issues |
| **Terminology** | Correct domain-specific terms | Inappropriate or Inconsistent terms |

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Completely changes meaning or makes text unusable
- **Major**: Significantly impacts understanding or quality
- **Minor**: Noticeable but doesn't severely impact quality

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox)
- **Logic**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage API
